Throughout the unit, students will learn to plan or describe activities and sequence of events and steps in a process. Teachers can facilitate opportunities for students to express themselves verbally and non-verbally. As students work together to build scenes, they will also explore common literary elements, such as settings, characters, and events. Most importantly, the lessons will help students to become problem-solvers by enhancing their creativity, collaboration, and communication skills.", "Click here to find additional learning experiences with StoryTales."],
